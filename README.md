# HKViz mod


A Hollow Knight mod which records information about player movement and collected items, health, charms, deaths over time.
This allows visualizing that data, like seeing the path one has taken in playthrough, to which boss one has died the most, where one has spent the most time, and more.

The visualizations + website for viewing recordings is contained in the [hkviz-web repository](https://github.com/hkviz/hkviz-web).

Checkout [hkviz.olii.dev](https://hkviz.olii.dev/) for more infos. 

## I have Ideas/Feedback (e.g. for some additional data to record.)
Feel free to [open a issue](https://github.com/hkviz/hkviz-mod/issues) on this repository or write @olivergrack on discord.
