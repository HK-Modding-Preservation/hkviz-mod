# HKViz mod

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This mod is still work in progress. It can not be used yet. A first release should follow late 2023 or early 2024.

A Hollow Knight mod which records information about player movement and collected items, health, charms, deaths over time.
This allows visualizing that data, like seeing the complete path one has taken in playthrough or seeing to which boss one has died the most.

The visualizations + website for uploading recordings is contained in the [hkviz-web repository](https://github.com/hkviz/hkviz-web).

Checkout [hkviz.vercel.app](https://hkviz.vercel.app/) for more infos. 

## I have Ideas/Feedback (e.g. for some additional data to record.)
